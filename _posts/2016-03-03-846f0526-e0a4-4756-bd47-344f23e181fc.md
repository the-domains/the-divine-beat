Here's a thought. 

Why not have a belief system and morality based solely on music?

The concepts of rhythm and tonal harmony are relatively universally present in every major religion and belief system on the planet. 

So why not strip away all the nonsense. Lose the crap about an afterlife, the invisible friend in the sky, and the arbitrary rules that condone hate. 

Hate is never okay. Love and harmony. Tolerance and acceptance. These are the concepts worth believing in. 

So, why not a music-based religion. 

The temple of the divine beat.
