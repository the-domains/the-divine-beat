On the subject of Trust.

We as sentient beings have developed a concept of trust and of honesty, but what does this really mean? 

Although it's easy to say that trust means "I know you won't take advantage of me." Is that the extent of what it means? 

From my limited perspective, it seems that what trust really refers to is mutual predictability. You know you can trust me because, out of the set of all actions possible, for subset X, when you do X, you know I'll do Y. And you like Y. For instance you know that when you cry in front of me, you know I'll ask if there's anything I can do to help. 

Isn't it interesting that we feel more comfortable around humans when they act more like machines?
