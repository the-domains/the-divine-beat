On the subject of discord.

Recently, I have found myself in difficulty, regarding synchronization with the divine beat. 

I was having difficulty identifying the source of my issues until today. 

My problem seems to be that I have been unwilling to accept some of my less enjoyable emotions. Fear, pain, anger, frustration, loneliness, envy, regret... These are all things that we must accept about ourselves.

You have these feelings. Everyone does. But if we do not learn to accept them, we create discord and disharmony in ourselves. 

It is okay to be in pain. It is okay to be sad. It is okay to have regrets. To fear the unknown. To have doubts. 

These thoughts feelings are natural. Although they create disharmony in and of themselves, they are unfortunately inescapable for conscious beings. So, just like finding a way to live in peace with someone who you disagree with, you must live in peace with your emotions. Accept your pain. Accept your fear. 

Accept yourself. For otherwise, it is impossible to be in harmony with the universe. Because you are part of the universe.
